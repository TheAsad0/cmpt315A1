    <h1>Why I took this class</h1>
    <p>Even though I'm in the Information & security stream at macewan, I wanted to take this class to 
        better understand the different components of building a website. It also doesn't hurt to have
        knowledge in web development for a potential job in the future.

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>As mentioned previously, some of my hobbies include gaming, soccer, and hiking. Most of the games 
        I like to play single player games like elden ring or god of war. I like going for hikes out in either 
        Banff or jasper. I enjoy being away from the city and out in nature. I would say I enjoy the sceneries 
        more than the hike itself.
